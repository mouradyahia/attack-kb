# Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure

This lab has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input.

To solve the lab, retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete the user `carlos`.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

####  Solution

-  Log in using the supplied credentials and access the user account page.
-  Change the "id" parameter in the URL to `administrator`.
-  View the response in Burp and observe that it contains the administrator's password.
-  Log in to the administrator account and delete `carlos`.
