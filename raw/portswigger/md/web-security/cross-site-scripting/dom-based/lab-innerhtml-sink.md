# Lab: DOM XSS in `innerHTML` sink using source `location.search`

This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an `innerHTML` assignment, which changes the HTML contents of a `div` element, using data from `location.search`.

To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert` function.

####  Solution

-

Enter the following into the into the search box:

```
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

-  Click "Search".

The value of the `src` attribute is invalid and throws an error. This triggers the `onerror` event handler, which then calls the `alert()` function. As a result, the payload is executed whenever the user's browser attempts to load the page containing your malicious post.
